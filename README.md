# HTML_Forge

## Description
HTML Forge is a Web-Based application that converts a Graphical User Interface (GUI) mockup into HTML5 code by leveraging the power of Machine Learning. The process of converting a GUI into code is generally the responsibility of developers. The process itself is time-consuming and prevents developers from allocating their time to more time-demanding issues such as implementing logic and functionality into an application. HTML Forge is designed to speed up work-flow, and allows developers and students alike to speed up their web development tasks by simplifying the process into a simple upload and convert button.
